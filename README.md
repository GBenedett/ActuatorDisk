Actuator disk
============
For a master thesis project the theroy of the actuator disk will be analized and a calculation code to be integrated to CEASIOMpy will be implemented, useful for studying real cases for future applications.

Blade element theory 
--------------------

The first part of the project is to implementa a code in Python to perform a calculation using the blade element theory.
The first step is to calculate the thrust coefficient and the torque coefficient, this is possible thanks to an algortim in python translated by matlab founded on this [Aerodynamics4students](http://www.aerodynamics4students.com/propulsion/blade-element-propeller-theory.php) site.
The purpose is to improve this code and add it correctly to CEASIOMpy.
