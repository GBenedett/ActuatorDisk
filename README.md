Actuator disk
============
For a master thesis project the theory of the actuator disk will be analized and a calculation code to be integrated to CEASIOMpy will be implemented, useful for studying real cases for future applications.

Blade element theory 
--------------------

The first part of the project is to implement a code in Python to perform a straightforward calculation using the blade element theory, which provides the division of the blade into sections to calculate thrust and torque of every element in order to obtain the total thrust.This is possible thanks to an algortim in Python translated by matlab founded on this [Aerodynamics4students](http://www.aerodynamics4students.com/propulsion/blade-element-propeller-theory.php) site.
The purpose is to improve this code and add it correctly to CEASIOMpy.
